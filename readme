What authorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of information given
in the "Policies" web page (also available on armlab in the file
~cos217/AuthorizedSourcesList ) to this section of the readme file,
and edit it as appropriate.

The course's lectures.
The course's precepts.
The course's website.
The course's current staff members outside of class time through 
office hours.
Current Intro Lab TAs through visits to the Intro COS Lab.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

None

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

I found it more enjoyable that the last assignment for sure. The 
expansion portion, while challenging, was rewarding when I was able to 
get a solution working.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

N/A

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

   symtablelist.c: line 61: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

   symtablelist.c: line 100: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

   symtablelist.c: line 185: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvExtra' through an assert?

I disagree with all three of these warnings because all the 
variables that criTer is suggesting to assert can be NULL
and thus it shouldn't be a concern if we aren't asserting these values. If anything it would break the functionality
of the code if we were to validate these parameters in the 
event that any of these values were passed as NULL.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on symtablehash.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on symtablehash.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

    symtablehash.c: line 154: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

   symtablehash.c: line 199: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

   symtablehash.c: line 291: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvExtra' through an assert?

Once again, all these warnings are similar in that I disagree
with all 3 of them due to the fact that asserting pvValue and pvExtra would break the functionality of a the code since
these values can be NULL values.

What are the CPU times reported by testsymtable.c with binding counts
50, 500, 5000, 50000, and 500000 using (1) your linked list
implementation, (2) your non-expanding hash table implementation, and
(3) your expanding hash table implementation? Fill in the blanks.

The linked list implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0.006426 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 1.028644 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 101.643270 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed KILLED seconds.

The non-expanding hash table implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 0.011203 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 0.356048 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed 68.507551 seconds.

The expanding hash table implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 0.007512 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 0.118510 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed 1.621 seconds.
